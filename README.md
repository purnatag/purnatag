**purnatag/purnatag** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a ~academic~ researcher, currently working at [Subconscious Compute](https://www.subcom.tech/) as a Computational Engineer, on the _PRODUCT DESIGN_ side of things.
I also am an artist on the side!
